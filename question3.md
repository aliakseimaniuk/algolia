### Answer 3

Hello Leo,

Thank you for your email. In order to connect the Algolia search to your site, you do not need to spend a lot of time. Integration consists of 3 steps.

1) Synchronize your data with Algolia
2) Configure Algolia search
3) Connect UI widgets to your application.

To ease the integration of Algolia, we provide:

1. A full-featured dashboard to manage data and configurations.
1. API clients for 10 languages (PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, iOS, Android, C#, Java, Golang and Scala).
1. A set of front-end libraries called InstantSearch, to help you implement Algolia on your website (vanilla JS, React, Vue) or application (iOS, Android).
1. Integrations for frameworks, including Laravel, Symfony, Django, and Rails.
1. Extensions for Magento 1, Magento 2, Shopify, Wordpress, Zendesk, and Jekyll.

To help you better, I'd like need to know what technologies you use. Could you please share this information with me?

Best regards,
Alexei
