# Simple contact management system using Angular and Algolia

In this demo I'd like to show you how to use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) with [Angular](https://angular.io/) application.

## Basic idea

Implement contact book. User should be able to search for contact information (address, phone number) by a person's last name and first name.
In addition to that user should be able to retrieve all contacts from a specific company.
